          "description": "18 Road is an expansive 40 mile network of singletrack trails in the North Fruita Desert that is exceedingly popular with mountain bikers, but is also open to hikers. Many of the trails wind through the flatter desert surrounding the gravel road. Some climb the steep dirt mounds, and The Edge goes all the way up to the bluffs. It gets very, very hot here during the summer, so be prepared! This is a great place for a winter hike, though!",
